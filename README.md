This project is a web-based donation sharing platform developed as a course assignment.
The system allows users to upload donation items, browse available donations, and manage donation-related information.

The frontend is responsible for user interaction and page rendering, while the backend handles request processing, business logic, and database operations.
Donation data is stored in a cloud-based MySQL database deployed on Railway, and image files are managed using Cloudinary.

The system is deployed online, and all functions can be accessed directly through a web browser without requiring local installation.
